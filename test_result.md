Backend logs show: 'GET /api/projects HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect' followed by 'GET /api/projects/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK'. The frontend calls /api/projects (no trailing slash) but FastAPI redirects to /api/projects/ (with trailing slash). This redirect breaks the fetch() call in the browser, causing the error. Additionally, authentication flow has issues - signup works but users aren't properly authenticated afterward, showing 'You're not signed in' on projects page."

Backend shows 307 redirects for /api/projects. This needs immediate investigation - likely API routing or authentication issue."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🔍 DETAILED DEBUG COMPLETE: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED for 'Failed to fetch' error. The issue is a trailing slash mismatch in API routes. Frontend calls /api/projects but backend redirects to /api/projects/ (307 redirect). This breaks fetch() calls. Backend logs confirm: 'GET /api/projects HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect' → 'GET /api/projects/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK'. SOLUTION: Either fix frontend to use trailing slash OR fix backend routing to handle both. Also found authentication persistence issue - signup works but users not properly authenticated afterward."

CRITICAL FAILURES CONFIRMED: 1) Signup flow broken - form gets stuck in 'Creating account...' state, no redirect to projects. 2) 'Failed to fetch' error prominently displayed in red on projects page. 3) Project creation completely non-functional - zero projects created or displayed. 4) Backend logs show consistent 307 redirects for /api/projects calls. The trailing slash routing issue makes the entire project management feature unusable. Authentication APIs respond correctly (201/200) but project functionality is completely broken. URGENT: Main agent must fix API routing before any project features can work."
