        comment: "❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The 'Failed to fetch' error is caused by 307 redirects from /api/projects to /api/projects/. Backend logs show: 'GET /api/projects HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect' followed by 'GET /api/projects/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK'. The frontend calls /api/projects (no trailing slash) but FastAPI redirects to /api/projects/ (with trailing slash). This redirect breaks the fetch() call in the browser, causing the error. Additionally, authentication flow has issues - signup works but users aren't properly authenticated afterward, showing 'You're not signed in' on projects page."
